# Frontend

This directory is intentionally left empty.

You are free to use any frontend framework or tooling of your choice (e.g. React, Vue, Angular, etc.).

## Example: Create a React app

To scaffold a new React project inside this directory, run:

```bash
npx create-react-app@latest .
```

Make sure to run this command inside the `src/frontend` directory.

Once set up, you can run the frontend development server and start building your UI.

Happy coding!
